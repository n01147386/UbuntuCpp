COMPILING:
g++ -c main.cpp


LINKING:
You must then link the compiled file to the SFML libraries in order to get the final executable. SFML is made of 5 modules (system, window, graphics, network and audio), and there's one library for each of them.
To link an SFML library, you must add "-lsfml-xxx" to your command line, for example "-lsfml-graphics" for the graphics module (the "lib" prefix and the ".so" extension of the library file name must be omitted). 

g++ main.o -o sfml-app -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
